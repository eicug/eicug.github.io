### Theoretical Physics  

The Theoretical Physics Working Group solicits overarching questions/topics from the EIC community for discussions involving both theorists and experimentalists. The questions or topics can be submitted on a form on their [Wiki page](https://wiki.bnl.gov/eicug/index.php/Theory){:target="_blank"}. The conveners are:
* Wim Cosyn (Florida International University) - <wcosyn@fiu.edu>
* Anna Stasto (Penn State) - <ams52@psu.edu>
* Alessandro Bacchetta (Univerity of Pavia and INFN) - <alessandro.bacchetta@unipv.it>
* Felix Ringer (Stony Brook University) - <felix.ringer@stonybrook.edu>

### Software

The Software Working Group (SWG) is open to all members of the EICUG to work on all aspects of EIC Software. The initial focus of the SWG is on physics and detector simulations and the support of the ongoing development of the science program and detectors for the EIC. The work plan of the SWG has involved from the [Expression of Interest for Software](https://eic.github.io/activities/eoi.html){:target="_blank"} that is based on input from the wider community.

#### AI Working Group

EIC has the unique opportunity to start incorporating AI from the very beginning and to systematically leverage on it during all phases of the project. AI will be an integral part of the EIC software and we will take advantage of intelligent decisions in all aspects of data processing from detector readout and control to analysis. To work in this direction, there is an AI Working Group (AI) as part of the SWG. The AIWG will serve as an [entry point to AI applications](https://eic.ai){:target="_blank"} and will organize workshops, tutorials, and Kaggle-like challenges. 

##### Communication
The SWG communicates via its [mailing list](mailto:eicug-software@eicug.org){:target="_blank"} and organizes regular [online and in-person meetings](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/301/){:target="_blank"} as well as tutorials that enable broad and active participation from within the EICUG as a whole. For questions about the Software Working Group, please contact the [conveners](mailto:eicug-software-conveners@eicug.org){:target="_blank"}: 
* Andrea Bressan (University of Trieste and INFN)
* Markus Diefenthaler (Jefferson Lab)
* Cristiano Fanelli (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
* Tanja Horn (Catholic University of America)
* Torre Wenaus (BNL)

### Computing&nbsp;Coordination

The Computing Coordination Group coordinates resources among EIC computing efforts, keeps records of required and available resources and their usage, acts as the contact point for institutions that intend to contribute computing resources, performs infrastructure assessments to fold in international computing resources, and pursues and develops in-common data flow and management practices.
* Liaisons for EIC computing resources at the host labs:
    * Jerome Lauret - BNL - <jeromel@bnl.gov>
    * Graham Heyes - JLab - <heyes@jlab.org>
* [EICUG Software/AI Working Group](#software) delegates:
    * Andrea Bressan - <andrea.bressan@ts.infn.it>
    * Cristiano Fanelli - <cfanelli@mit.edu>
* EIC Detector-1 Computing/Software Working Group delegate:
    * David Lawrence - <davidl@jlab.org>
* EIC Detector-1 Simulation, Production and QA Working Group delegate:
    * Wouter Deconinck - <wouter.deconinck@umanitoba.ca>

### Polarimetry

Conveners:
* Elke Aschenauer - BNL - <elke@bnl.gov>
* Dave Gaskell  - JLab - <gaskelld@jlab.org>

The group has a dedicated [Indico category](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/280/){:target="_blank"}
as well as the [mailing list](mailto:eicug-polarimetry@eicug.org) _(eicug-polarimetry@eicug.org)_.

### Collaborative Tools

The EICUG community currently supports and is using the following collaborative tools:
* This website
* Google Groups (mailing lists)
* Google Calendar
* Wiki
* Dropbox
* [Zenodo documentation database for the EICUG](https://zenodo.org/communities/eicug/){:target="_blank"}.
* GitHub Pages (for software code management and documentation)

If you have questions or need assistance with the EIC Collaborative Tools please contact
the coordinator: potekhin_at_bnl.gov.
