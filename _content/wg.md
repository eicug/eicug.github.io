### Theoretical Physics  

The Theoretical Physics Working Group solicits overarching questions/topics from the EIC community for discussions involving both theorists and experimentalists. The questions or topics can be submitted on a form on their [Wiki page](https://wiki.bnl.gov/eicug/index.php/Theory){:target="_blank"}. 

The conveners are:
* Wim Cosyn (Florida International University, USA) - <wcosyn@fiu.edu>
* Anna Stasto (Penn State University, USA) - <ams52@psu.edu>
* Alessandro Bacchetta (University of Pavia and INFN-Pavia, Italy) - <alessandro.bacchetta@unipv.it>
* Felix Ringer (Stony Brook University, USA) - <felix.ringer@stonybrook.edu>

### Detector-2/IP8

The Detector-2/IP8 Working Group is charged to
1. Engage the broader community, including theorists, accelerator physicists and ePIC
experimentalists, to fully develop projections for the portfolio of measurements that are
complementary to the ePIC physics program, including those that capitalize on the implementation
of the secondary focus.
2. Work with the EICUG Steering Committee and Project to recruit new institutions and establish a
diverse and vibrant 2nd Detector working group.
3. Utilize the extended design period for Detector 2 to identify groups that will focus on R&D for
emerging technologies that could provide another aspect of complementarity to ePIC.
4. Facilitate the development of a unified concept for a general-purpose detector at IR8. In particular,
the 2nd detector should be complementary to the project detector at IR6 and may capitalize on the
possibility of a secondary focus at IR8.

The conveners are:
*  Sangbaek Lee (ANL, USA)
*  Simonetta Liuti (University of Virginia, USA)
*  Pawel Nadel-Turonski (Stony Brook University, USA)
*  Thomas Ullrich (BNL/Yale, USA)
*  Anselm Vossen (Duke University/JLab, USA)

Drawing on experience from Yellow Report working groups, two sub-groups of the Detector-2 Working Group have been formed: one to articulate the Detector-2 physics program and its implications for detector design ("Physics"), and one to study detector concepts and quantify the implications for the physics measurements ("Detector"). 
The conveners are: 

__Physics Co-conveners__
   * Charles Hyde
   * Bjorn Schenke

__Detector Co-conveners__
   * Ernst Sichterman

The Detector-2 Working Group can be reached at this [Mailing list](mailto:eic-det2-l@lists.bnl.gov){:target="_blank"}. 

__Indico__ web pages for meetings can be found [here](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/439/){:target="_blank"}.

### Monte Carlo Event Generators

The Monte Carlo Event Generators (MCEG) Working Group is charged to continue the development of MC event generators needed to realize the EIC science program. The MCEG will serve also as a platform for cross-collaboration between theory and experiment, ePIC Collaboration and Detector-2/IP8 Working Group. In particular, it will provide technical expertise and computing support to Detector-2/IP8. The MCEG will continue to coordinate with external theory and phenomenology, simulation and software groups, such as MCNet and the HEP Software Foundation, and will organize events to educate and assist the EIC community in utilizing these tools. 

The conveners are:
*  Frank Krauss (Durham University, UK)  <frank.krauss@durham.ac.uk>
*  Ilkka Helenius (University of Jyväskylä, Finland) <ilkka.m.helenius@jyu.fi>

### Artificial Intelligence

The mission of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Working Group is to develop and maintain connections to the data science community, and engaging with the rapidly evolving AI/ML  (Machine Learning) toolset that may impact the realization of the EIC science mission. The AI will organize events to educate and assist the EIC community in utilizing AI/ML techniques in the area of detector design and controls, simulations, data readout and analysis, and theory and phenomenology. The AI will also serve as an [entry point to AI applications](https://eic.ai){:target="_blank"}. 

The conveners are:
*  Tanja Horn (CUA, USA)  <hornt@cua.edu>
*  Cristiano Fanelli (William & Mary University, USA) <cfanelli@wm.edu>

### EIC Computing and Software Joint Institute

After entering the Phase 3 defined in the EICUG Charter, the structure of the former Computing Coordination Working Group has been revisited and its functionalities transferred to a new structure named EIC Computing and Software Joint Institute (ECSJI). The ECSJI is external to the EICUG and manages all requests of computing resources at host labs (Jefferson Lab and BNL) by any (inter)national group working on the EIC physics. 

The contact points are:
*  Amber Boehnlein (Jefferson Lab, USA) <amber@jlab.org>
*  Eric Lancon (BNL, USA) <elancon@bnl.gov>

### Collaborative Tools

The EICUG community currently supports and is using the following collaborative tools:
* This website
* Google Groups (mailing lists)
* Google Calendar
* Wiki
* Dropbox
* [Zenodo documentation database for the EICUG](https://zenodo.org/communities/eicug/){:target="_blank"}.
* GitHub Pages (for software code management and documentation)

If you have questions or need assistance with the EIC Collaborative Tools, please contact the coordinator: <potekhin@bnl.gov> .

### Software

The Software Working Group (SWG) is open to all members of the EICUG to work on all aspects of EIC Software. The initial focus of the SWG is on physics and detector simulations and the support of the ongoing development of the science program and detectors for the EIC. The work plan of the SWG has involved from the [Expression of Interest for Software](https://eic.github.io/activities/eoi.html){:target="_blank"} that is based on input from the wider community.

#### AI Working Group

EIC has the unique opportunity to start incorporating AI from the very beginning and to systematically leverage on it during all phases of the project. AI will be an integral part of the EIC software and we will take advantage of intelligent decisions in all aspects of data processing from detector readout and control to analysis. To work in this direction, there is an AI Working Group (AI) as part of the SWG. The AIWG will serve as an [entry point to AI applications](https://eic.ai){:target="_blank"} and will organize workshops, tutorials, and Kaggle-like challenges. 

#### Communication
The SWG communicates via its [mailing list](mailto:eicug-software@eicug.org){:target="_blank"} and organizes regular [online and in-person meetings](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/301/){:target="_blank"} as well as tutorials that enable broad and active participation from within the EICUG as a whole. For questions about the Software Working Group, please contact the [conveners](mailto:eicug-software-conveners@eicug.org){:target="_blank"}: 
* Andrea Bressan (University of Trieste and INFN)
* Markus Diefenthaler (Jefferson Lab)
* Cristiano Fanelli (William & Mary)
* Tanja Horn (Catholic University of America)
* Torre Wenaus (BNL) -->
