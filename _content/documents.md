### Yellow Report

#### About

The Yellow Report is available as [e-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05419){:target="_blank"}. The purpose of the __Yellow Report__ Initiative is to advance the state and detail of the documented physics studies (White Paper, INT program proceedings)  and detector concepts (Detector and R&D Handbook) in preparation for the realization of the EIC. The aim is to provide the basis for further development of concepts for experimental equipment best suited for science needs, including complementarity of two detectors towards future Technical Design Reports (TDRs). The Yellow Report strategy is outlined below:

* Quantify physics measurements for existing or new physics topics and implications for detector design (“Physics Group”)
  * Go beyond physics motivation to implication for detector requirements
  * Physics considerations for two independent complementary detectors
* Study detector concepts based on the requirements defined above, and quantify implications for the physics measurements (“Detector Group”)
  * Balance detector concepts versus impact on physics measurements.
Document complementarity (+ reduction of systematics) of detectors.
  * Fold in ancillary detectors, measurements (polarimetry, luminosity, …)
  * Engage EIC-detector R&D consortia
* Study opportunities for accelerator physics experiments at a future EIC (“Accelerator Physics Group”)
  * EIC, once built, will be unique facility to push frontiers of accelerator S&T
  * Document ideas for experiments to study further push of EIC performance and/or generic accelerator R&D
