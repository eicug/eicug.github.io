### The Initiative

The purpose of the Yellow Report Initiative is to advance the state and detail of the documented physics studies (White Paper, INT program proceedings)  and detector concepts (Detector and R&D Handbook) in preparation for the realization of the EIC. The effort aims to provide the basis for further development of concepts for experimental equipment best suited for science needs, including complementarity of two detectors towards future Technical Design Reports (TDRs).

### Audience

The main audience of the Yellow Report is the EIC community itself, represented by the existing EIC User Group and prospective new members. The report will reflect the consensus view of the user group on what requirements EIC detectors have to meet and what detector technologies and concepts to deploy to harvest the rich physics program of an EIC as detailed in the White Paper, the NAS report, and in various recent studies. The report will be written at the expert level.

The content of the report can subsequently be used by members of the community as the basis for further documentation, after necessary modifications to meet the level of the respective audience.  Such audiences could be funding agencies, technical and project review committees, and media/press. It is expected that future collaborations will use the knowledge compiled in the Yellow Reports to guide the design and development of the actual EIC detectors.

As such the Yellow Report is an investment in the future of an Electron-Ion Collider.

### Strategy

* Quantify physics measurements for existing or new physics topics and implications for detector design (“Physics Group”)
  * Go beyond physics motivation to implication for detector requirements
  * Physics considerations for two independent complementary detectors
* Study detector concepts based on the requirements defined above, and quantify implications for the physics measurements (“Detector Group”)
  * Balance detector concepts versus impact on physics measurements.
Document complementarity (+ reduction of systematics) of detectors.
  * Fold in ancillary detectors, measurements (polarimetry, luminosity, …)
  * Engage EIC-detector R&D consortia
* Study opportunities for accelerator physics experiments at a future EIC (“Accelerator Physics Group”)
  * EIC, once built, will be unique facility to push frontiers of accelerator S&T
  * Document ideas for experiments to study further push of EIC performance and/or generic accelerator R&D
