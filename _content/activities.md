### Yellow Report

#### About

The Yellow Report was released as an [e-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05419){:target="_blank"} on March 8th, 2021.
Its aim was to provide the basis for further development of concepts for experimental equipment best suited for science needs,
including complementarity of two detectors towards future Technical Design Reports (TDRs).
The Yellow Report development strategy was formulated along the following lines:

* Quantify physics measurements for existing or new physics topics and implications for detector design (“Physics Group”)
  * Go beyond physics motivation to implication for detector requirements
  * Physics considerations for two independent complementary detectors
* Study detector concepts based on the requirements defined above, and quantify implications for the physics measurements (“Detector Group”)
  * Balance detector concepts versus impact on physics measurements. Document complementarity (+ reduction of systematics) of detectors.
  * Fold in ancillary detectors, measurements (polarimetry, luminosity, …)
  * Engage EIC-detector R&D consortia
* Study opportunities for accelerator physics experiments at a future EIC (“Accelerator Physics Group”)
  * EIC, once built, will be unique facility to push frontiers of accelerator S&T
  * Document ideas for experiments to study further push of EIC performance and/or generic accelerator R&D
