### Purpose

The Electron-Ion Collider User Group (EICUG) is an international affiliation of scientists dedicated to developing and promoting the scientific, technological, and educational goals and motivations for a new high energy
[Electron-Ion Collider](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/){:target="_blank"}.
A detailed scientific description can be found in the
[last edition of the White Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1701){:target="_blank"} (Eur.Phys.J. A 52 (2016) 268),
as well as in the [EIC Yellow Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05419) (Nucl.Phys. A1026 (2022) 122447), which contains also a detailed description of the requirements for a general-purpose large-acceptance conceptual detector. The EIC has been recommended as highest priority in both the [2015 U.S. Nuclear Science Advisory Committee
Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1296778){:target="_blank"} "Reaching for the Horizon", and the [2023 U.S. Nuclear Science Advisory Committee Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science](https://science.osti.gov/-/media/np/nsac/pdf/202310/NSAC-LRP-2023-v12.pdf) "New Era of Discovery".

### Membership, Phone Book and Organization

Membership in the EICUG is open to all scientists actively engaged in Electron-Ion Collider related science, detector R&D, simulations and design. Information regarding joining the EICUG is available at the [dedicated page]({{ '/content/join.html' | relative_url }}) on this site. The EICUG maintains its
[membership database](https://phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/eic/client){:target="_blank"},
a.k.a. the "phone book".
The EICUG organization is defined by the Phase III of the [EICUG Charter]({{ '/assets/documents/EICUG_Charter_vote.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, which was approved in December of 2022.  The Steering Committee has completed the implementation and the transition to the new structure described in this document by June 1, 2023.  The previous Phase II Charter may be found here [EICUG II Charter]({{ '/assets/documents/EICUG-Charter-01122018.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}.

### Governance

The EICUG is governed by the Steering Committee [SC](#steering-committee).

The SC is formed by twelve (12) members: the Chair line (Chair, Past Chair, Chair-elect), two regular members, two representatives from world regions outside the US, one early-career scientist, the Chair of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee [DE&I](#diversity-and-inclusion-committee), one representative of the ePIC Collaboration, two representatives selected by the host laboratories (Jefferson Lab, Brookhaven National Lab) / EIC Project. 

The ePIC Collaboration and the host laboratories / EIC Project appoint their representatives for a one year term, and can reappoint or replace them at their discretion. 

All other SC members are elected for a three-years term based on a broad call for volunteers and nominations to the entire EICUG community. Nominations for the elections shall be solicited by the [Elections and Nominating Committee](#elections-and-nominating-committee). Every year, three new members (one of which is the Chair-elect) shall be elected for three-years terms. 

The SC appoints the [Elections and Nominating Committee](#elections-and-nominating-committee).

The officers of the EICUG are the SC Chair, the Chair-elect and the most recent Past Chair. The SC Chair is the EICUG Spokesperson.

The SC mailing list is <mailto:eicug-sc@eicug.org>
