## The Proton

### Proton Structure

  <div class="col-8">
The proton, the most abundant element in the visible universe: how does its inside look like? How do its macroscopic properties (mass, spin, . . .) arise from the dynamics of its constituents? 

The purpose of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is to answer these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the internal structure of ordinary matter in terms of its elementary constituents, the quarks and the gluons (collectively, partons).

### Proton Mass

  <div class="col-3"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/site/Nmass3.png' | relative_url }}"></div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
The Higgs mechanism, recently verified at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), explains the origin of the masses of the fundamental particles (i.e., of the particles with no internal structure), including the electron and the quark, whilst the photon and the gluon remain massless. 
However, the Higgs mechanism accounts for only almost 1% of the mass of proton. Where does the rest come from?

### Proton Spin

<div class="row" style="width:90%">
  <div class="col-3"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/site/spin-budget.png' | relative_url }}"></div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
Similarly, nowadays we know that the spin of the quarks accounts for only one-third of the spin of the proton. We have a largely inaccurate knowledge of the contribution from gluons. And we don't know yet how to unambiguously extract from experimental data information on the orbital motion of partons. 

The EIC will address these fundamental questions by forming the first ever detailed spatial and momentum 3D images of partons inside the proton and also in heavier elements.

## The Theory of Strong Force: QCD

<div class="row" style="width:90%">
  <div class="col-3"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/site/gluons.jpg' | relative_url }}"></div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
  Quarks have an electric charge that determines their response to the electromagnetic force. But they are assigned also a color charge that describes their interaction through the strong force. The theory behind strong interactions is called Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). Like electrically charged particles interact by exchanging massless neutral photons, color-charged quarks interact by exchanging massless, neutral but color-charged, gluons.

    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
Gluons carry the energy of strong interactions. Because of Einstein's famous equivalence E=mc2, this energy can be converted into mass by creating from vacuum pairs of quark and antiquark equivalents. At the same time, antiquark-quark pairs can annihilate producing energy as new gluons.

  <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
According to the uncertainty principle of Quantum Mechanics, these extra particles are constantly popping up and disappearing again. Therefore, the internal structure of the nucleon is very complicated and "busy". It is similar to the animation on the left, which represents a calculation of gluon fluctuations in the vacuum. The animation occupies a box about the size of two protons (2.4 fm) x (2.4 fm) x (3.6 fm), with 1 fm = 1 femto-meter = one one-hundred-millionth the diameter of an atom (one trillionth of a millimeter). 
The energy contained in these fluctuations of gluons and antiquark-quark pairs accounts for approximately 99% of the mass of the proton and of all ordinary matter in the universe. 
Because of the Einstein's relation, we are essentially made of energy, while only 1% of our mass is due to the Higgs mechanism! However, how does this work out in detail, we don't know.

##  Proton Tomography

<div class="row" style="width:90%">
  <div class="col-3"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/site/3D_view.png' | relative_url }}"></div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
  The above internal picture of the proton as made of quarks bound together with the fluctuating sea of gluons and antiquark-quark pairs, is suggested by QCD. However, the theory is experimentally verified to very high accuracy only at high energies, namely at energies much larger than the scale set by the mass of the proton. When nucleons bind together to make atomic nuclei, the average binding energy is around 1% of their original mass. Phenomena at this low energy scale (at least, low for QCD) are much more difficult to predict within QCD to better than 20%.
  </div>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="width:90%">
By providing detailed spatial and momentum 3D maps of parton dynamics, the EIC will be able to display how the mass is distributed inside the proton, pinpointing the different contributions coming from quarks, gluons, and antiquark-quark pairs popping up from the vacuum. 
</div>

<br/>
<div class="row" style="width:90%">
  <div class="col-3"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/site/spin-proton.png' | relative_url }}"></div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
Because the mass of the quarks is so much smaller than the mass of the proton, the quarks move at almost the speed of light inside the proton. As a consequence the forces between quarks depend very strongly on the relative orientation of their spins. This is analogous to the forces between two strong magnets (whose magnetism is due to the spin and orbital motion of bound atomic electrons). 
<br/>
The EIC will for the first time collide electrons and protons with precision control of the spin of both colliding particles.  This will allow the experiments to map out how the 3D distributions of quarks and gluons change when the quark or gluon spin is parallel or anti-parallel to the proton spin.

##  Matter at very high density

---

<div class="row" style="width:90%">
  <div class="col-3"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/site/nonlineargluon.png' | relative_url }}"></div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), electrically charged particles interact by exchanging massless neutral photons. In QCD, color-charged quarks strongly interact by exchanging massless neutral gluons. However, gluons carry color charge and, therefore, they can interact among themselves. Not only quarks and antiquarks of a given momentum, but also gluons of a given momentum can radiate other gluons at a lower momentum. The rapid growth of gluon density was observed at the HERA collider as the momentum becomes smaller and smaller or, equivalently, as the wave length of the gluon (considered as a quantum wave) becomes longer and longer, even longer than the size of the proton.

  <div class="col-8">
The gluon density cannot rise indefinitely. At some critical value of the density,
the color-charged gluons can start to recombine and counterbalance the radiating process.
<br/>
The balance between gluon recombination and gluon splitting is called saturation.
This nonlinear regime describes a new state of matter at very high density and could be universal, i.e. it could be common to all nuclei.

Exploring nuclear matter at very high densities has profound implications also to astrophysics. 
Neutron stars are the collapsed remnants of stars that have exhausted their nuclear fusion energy cycle.
They are gigantic nuclei: a billion of billion times bigger than a lead nucleus, but with similar density,
and under enormous gravitational pressure.
  </div>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="width:90%">
Just like earthly minerals, there are many possible phases of quark-gluon matter at high density and pressure.
Accurately predicting these phases of the nuclear matter at the heart of neutron stars requires advances in our understanding of the quark-gluon structure of nuclear forces. Advances in QCD theory and experiments with the EIC will go hand in hand with new astrophysical observations. This year marked the first ever observation of the merger of two neutron stars. This extraordinary event was identified by the gravitational wave signals recorded in the LIGO and VIRGO instruments. The detailed gravitational-wave and gamma-ray signals from neutron star mergers depends upon the nuclear reactions happening over a wide range of nuclear densities.
