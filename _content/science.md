## The Goal

---

### Proton Structure

The proton, the most abundant element in the visible universe: how does its inside look like? How do its macroscopic properties (mass, spin, . . .) arise from the dynamics of its constituents? 

The purpose of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is to answer these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the internal structure of ordinary matter in terms of its elementary constituents, the quarks and the gluons (collectively, partons).

### Proton Mass

The Higgs mechanism, recently verified at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), explains the origin of the masses of the fundamental particles (i.e., of the particles with no internal structure), including the electron and the quark, whilst the photon and the gluon remain massless. 
However, the Higgs mechanism accounts for only almost 1% of the mass of proton. Where does the rest come from?

### Proton Spin

Similarly, nowadays we know that the spin of the quarks accounts for only one-third of the spin of the proton. We have a largely inaccurate knowledge of the contribution from gluons. And we don't know yet how to unambiguously extract from experimental data information on the orbital motion of partons. 

The EIC will address these fundamental questions by forming the first ever detailed spatial and momentum 3D images of partons inside the proton and also in heavier elements.
