## The Proton

### Proton Structure

The proton, the most abundant element in the visible universe: how does its inside look like? How do its macroscopic properties (mass, spin, . . .) arise from the dynamics of its constituents? 

The purpose of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is to answer these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the internal structure of ordinary matter in terms of its elementary constituents, the quarks and the gluons (collectively, partons).

### Proton Mass

  <div class="col-8">
The Higgs mechanism, recently verified at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), explains the origin of the masses of the fundamental particles (i.e., of the particles with no internal structure), including the electron and the quark, whilst the photon and the gluon remain massless. 
However, the Higgs mechanism accounts for only almost 1% of the mass of proton. Where does the rest come from?

### Proton Spin

  <div class="col-3">{% include siteimage.md file='spin-budget.png' %}</div>

  <div class="col-8">
Similarly, nowadays we know that the spin of the quarks accounts for only one-third of the spin of the proton. We have a largely inaccurate knowledge of the contribution from gluons. And we don't know yet how to unambiguously extract from experimental data information on the orbital motion of partons. 

The EIC will address these fundamental questions by forming the first ever detailed spatial and momentum 3D images of partons inside the proton and also in heavier elements.

## The Theory of Strong Force: QCD

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3">{% include siteimage.md file='gluons.jpg' %}"</div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
  Quarks have an electric charge that determines their response to the electromagnetic force. But they are assigned also a color charge that describes their interaction through the strong force. The theory behind strong interactions is called Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). Like electrically charged particles interact by exchanging massless neutral photons, color-charged quarks interact by exchanging massless, neutral but color-charged, gluons.

  <div class="col-8">
Gluons carry the energy of strong interactions. Because of Einstein's famous equivalence E=mc2, this energy can be converted into mass by creating from vacuum pairs of quark and antiquark equivalents. At the same time, antiquark-quark pairs can annihilate producing energy as new gluons.

  <div class="col-8">
According to the uncertainty principle of Quantum Mechanics, these extra particles are constantly popping up and disappearing again. Therefore, the internal structure of the nucleon is very complicated and "busy". It is similar to the animation on the left, which represents a calculation of gluon fluctuations in the vacuum. The animation occupies a box about the size of two protons (2.4 fm) x (2.4 fm) x (3.6 fm), with 1 fm = 1 femto-meter = one one-hundred-millionth the diameter of an atom (one trillionth of a millimeter). 
The energy contained in these fluctuations of gluons and antiquark-quark pairs accounts for approximately 99% of the mass of the proton and of all ordinary matter in the universe. 
Because of the Einstein's relation, we are essentially made of energy, while only 1% of our mass is due to the Higgs mechanism! However, how does this work out in detail, we don't know.

##  Proton Tomography

<div class="row">

    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
  The above internal picture of the proton as made of quarks bound together with the fluctuating sea of gluons and antiquark-quark pairs, is suggested by QCD. However, the theory is experimentally verified to very high accuracy only at high energies, namely at energies much larger than the scale set by the mass of the proton. When nucleons bind together to make atomic nuclei, the average binding energy is around 1% of their original mass. Phenomena at this low energy scale (at least, low for QCD) are much more difficult to predict within QCD to better than 20%.
  </div>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
By providing detailed spatial and momentum 3D maps of parton dynamics, the EIC will be able to display how the mass is distributed inside the proton, pinpointing the different contributions coming from quarks, gluons, and antiquark-quark pairs popping up from the vacuum. 
</div>

  <div class="col-3">{% include siteimage.md file='spin-proton.png' %}</div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
Because the mass of the quarks is so much smaller than the mass of the proton, the quarks move at almost the speed of light inside the proton. As a consequence the forces between quarks depend very strongly on the relative orientation of their spins. This is analogous to the forces between two strong magnets (whose magnetism is due to the spin and orbital motion of bound atomic electrons). 
<br/>
The EIC will for the first time collide electrons and protons with precision control of the spin of both colliding particles.  This will allow the experiments to map out how the 3D distributions of quarks and gluons change when the quark or gluon spin is parallel or anti-parallel to the proton spin.

##  Matter at very high density

<div class="row">

    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), electrically charged particles interact by exchanging massless neutral photons. In QCD, color-charged quarks strongly interact by exchanging massless neutral gluons. However, gluons carry color charge and, therefore, they can interact among themselves. Not only quarks and antiquarks of a given momentum, but also gluons of a given momentum can radiate other gluons at a lower momentum. The rapid growth of gluon density was observed at the HERA collider as the momentum becomes smaller and smaller or, equivalently, as the wave length of the gluon (considered as a quantum wave) becomes longer and longer, even longer than the size of the proton.

The gluon density cannot rise indefinitely. At some critical value of the density,
the color-charged gluons can start to recombine and counterbalance the radiating process.
<br/>
The balance between gluon recombination and gluon splitting is called saturation.
This nonlinear regime describes a new state of matter at very high density and could be universal, i.e. it could be common to all nuclei.

Exploring nuclear matter at very high densities has profound implications also to astrophysics.
Neutron stars are the collapsed remnants of stars that have exhausted their nuclear
fusionenergy cycle. They are gigantic nuclei: a billion of billion times
bigger than a lead nucleus, but with similar density, and under enormous gravitational pressure.
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
Just like earthly minerals, there are many possible phases of quark-gluon matter at high density and pressure.
Accurately predicting these phases of the nuclear matter at the heart of neutron stars requires advances in our understanding of the quark-gluon structure of nuclear forces. Advances in QCD theory and experiments with the EIC will go hand in hand with new astrophysical observations. This year marked the first ever observation of the merger of two neutron stars. This extraordinary event was identified by the gravitational wave signals recorded in the LIGO and VIRGO instruments. The detailed gravitational-wave and gamma-ray signals from neutron star mergers depends upon the nuclear reactions happening over a wide range of nuclear densities.

##   Parton Confinement and Creation of Mass

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3">{% include siteimage.md file='confinement.png' %}</div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">
The QCD predicts that the fluctuating sea of gluons and antiquark-quark pairs produces such a strong binding on the quarks that the latter cannot be observed as individual free particles. If we try to separate a color-charged quark and its antiquark equivalent, the interaction energy carried by the gluon converts into a new quark and its antiquark equivalent. The latter particles combine with the original ones to form two colorless mesons. This feature is peculiar of the strong force and is called confinement. 
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
Nobody has ever seen direct evidence of a color-charged particle. 
For example, if we bombard a target proton with a highly energetic electron we observe in the final state the scattered electron together with new particles, typically new hadrons like pions or kaons. However, the pattern of scattering reveales the existence of elementary quarks inside the proton. What happens?

##   Hadronization

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3">{% include siteimage.md file='fragmentation.png' %}</div>
    <div class="col-1">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-8">

The amount of energy delivered by the electron is absorbed by a single quark in the target proton. This quark is now recoiling at high energy, and interacting strongly with the surrounding medium. These interactions create antiquark-quark pairs, and the struck quark picks up an antiquark.
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
 This compact quark-antiquark system is now "screened" from the surrounding medium because it has no color charge, and it propagates freely while it generates additional gluons and antiquark-quark pairs, and eventually it evolves into a stable and long-lived particle like the detected pion or kaon. Sometimes, the struck quark picks up two other quarks rather than an antiquark, and the new system evolves into a proton, a neutron, or one of the strange baryons. 
The net result is that we can observe in the detector only colorless hadrons while we cannot see separately the colored elementary particles from which the hadrons emerge.
The EIC will study this "hadronization" process at all its steps, to understand better the distance scales involved in the initial screening and the final evolution into a colorless hadron. 
This hadronization process can be studied both in the vacuum surrounding the proton, and embedded in the nuclear medium of an atomic nucleus. A special feature of the EIC is the ability to fully reconstruct not only the set of colorless final particles produced by the colored struck quark, but also the excitation and decay of the nucleon and/or nucleus left behind.

##   Nuclear Binding

<div class="row">

It is nearly a century since the discovery of the neutron, and more than a century since the discovery of the proton and atomic nuclei. 
In that time, a detailed understanding has developed of how protons and neutrons (nucleons) bind together to make nuclei, based on semi-empirical descriptions of nucleon-nucleon forces. 

However, many fundamental puzzles remain, that are directly linked to the quark-gluon substructure of the proton and of nuclei.

The proton has a positive electrical charge, it bounds to a negatively charged electron to form the hydrogen atom. Hydrogen was created right after the Big Bang, then it became fuel for fusion reactions inside stars to forge most of the chemical elements. The simplest fusion reaction is the combining of one proton and its electrically neutral partner, the neutron, to make a deuterium - the heavy stable isotope of hydrogen.

The most crucial difference between a proton and a neutron is in their mass. 
In units of electron-Volt (eV), the mass of the proton is 938.27 million eV (938.27 MeV) while the mass of the neutron is 939.57 million eV (939.57 MeV). 
Just a tiny 0.14% but crucial difference!
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, it implies that neutrons decay into protons and not the other way around. 
The proton is stable: its calculated life time is ten billions of trillions times longer than the estimate of the age of the universe. 
Hence, the atoms are stable, and so do we who are made of atoms.

Had the neutron-proton mass difference been negative or closer to zero, all protons would have transformed into neutrons either spontaneously or through the so-called inverse beta decay. In both cases, after the Big Bang the universe would have transformed into a mash of neutral particles: no atoms, no stars, no life.

But had the mass difference been slightly bigger, fusion reactions to create elements heavier than the hydrogen would have become more difficult, if not impossible. The universe would be made only of hydrogen atoms: again no stars, no life.

Nuclear energy is released by fission of heavy nuclei in nuclear power reactors, and by fusion of light nuclei in stars and in laboratory plasmas. The simplest fusion reaction is the combining of one proton and one neutron to make a deuterium nucleus -- the heavy isotope of hydrogen. The deuterium is stable, but its proton and neutron contribute to its binding energy only by a mere 0.1% of their mass. This binding is so feeble, that two protons cannot bind to form a stable nucleus.
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
Even more remarkable, two neutrons cannot bind together. This has profound consequences for our universe. If two neutrons could bind to form a stable (or even long-lived) state, then our early universe would have rapidly evolved into neutron stars and black holes, completely bypassing the formation of stars and planetary solar systems. 
In short, to understand our very existence, we must understand how the interaction of color-charged quarks and gluons is modified inside the nuclear medium, and how this interaction creates the nuclear binding. And we must understand it to a precision greater than 0.1%. 

The EIC will be able to map the quark-gluon structure of interacting neutrons and protons in deuterium (2H), 3He, and heavier nuclei, via exclusive reactions with full reconstruction of the final states with two or three nucleons.

The EIC would be the most advanced particle collider of its type ever built:
<ul>
<li>
The EIC will have collision rates 100-1,000 times higher than the only previous electron-proton collider.
</li>
<li>
It will be able to collide electrons with large nuclei, not just protons.
</li>
<li>
 It will be the world’s first machine where both the proton and ion beams can be polarized, meaning the particles’ spins can be aligned in a controllable way.
</li>
</ul>

The EIC’s energy, high collision rates, and ability to collide electrons with large nuclei will enable explorations of a new form of matter in which gluons dominate. The polarization will allow scientists to solve longstanding questions about the origin of a proton’s spin, a property that makes MRI scanning technology possible but is still not fully understood.
