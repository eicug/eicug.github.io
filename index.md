## Welcome


This is the home page of the Electron-Ion Collider User Group *(EICUG)*.
The EICUG consists of more than 1200 physicists from over 250 laboratories
and universities from around the world (see the map of the EICUG member
institutions below):

EICUG memers are working together to realize a powerful new facility in the
United States with the aim of studying the particles, gluons, which
bind all the observable matter in the world around us. This new facility, known as the
[Electron-Ion Collider](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/){:target="_blank"} (EIC),
will collide intense beams of spin-polarized electrons with intense
beams of both polarized nucleons and unpolarized nuclei
from deuterium to uranium. Detector concepts are now being
developed to detect the high-energy scattered particles as well
as the low-energy debris as a means to definitively understand
how the matter we are all made of is bound together.
